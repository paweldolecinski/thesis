abstract = {Reaching a high level of consensus among experts is critical in group decision making problems. Usually, it is the moderator task to assure that the consensus process is carried out properly and, if possible, to offer recommendations to the expert in order to change their opinions and narrow their differences. In this paper we present an implemented web based consensus support system that is able to help, or even replace, the moderator in a consensus process where experts are allowed to provide their preferences using one of many types (fuzzy, linguistic and multi-granular linguistic) of incomplete preference relations. This system is based on both consistency and consensus measures and it has been designed to provide advice to the experts to increase group consensus level while maintaining the individual consistency of each expert. The consistency measures are characterized by and computed using uninorm operators. When appropriate, the system also helps experts to reduce the incompleteness of their preference relations. The web interface allows to carry out distributed consensus processes and thus, experts do not necessarily need to physically meet together.},

abstract = {In the context of classical multiple attribute decision making (MADM), it is often assumed that, before taking a decision, the decision maker has a clear picture of all available alternatives and is able to rank them according to a fixed set of criteria, at a certain point in time. Most real-world decisions, however, are far from this ideal situation: they occur in a highly dynamic environment, where new, previously unconsidered alternatives may be added and others may be rendered unnecessary by means of some exploratory process. The same is true for criteria, which may likewise change either in number and/or its relative importance, depending on the dynamic environment the decision in being taken. Moreover, past information about the alternatives' behavior should be passed from iteration to iteration. In this paper we introduce a flexible model for multiple attribute decision making in a dynamic context that can be applied to any dynamic decision process. Because of the dynamism introduced with the spatial-temporal dimension, we consider a formulation using basic concepts from set theory, and then proceed to show it how it can be mapped (at any fixed time) to the more common decision matrix formulation. The proposed model is completely general and can be easily applied to different dynamic decision making problems. To highlight its versatility, we additionally present a simple example dealing with the problem of selecting a supplier from a pool of possible ones.},

abstract = {Multiperson decision making (MPDM) problems with different formats of preference information are one of the emerging research areas in decision analysis. Existing approaches for dealing with different preference formats tend to be unwieldy. This paper proposes a new method to solve the problem, in which the preference information on alternatives provided by experts can be represented in four different formats, namely: 1) utility values; 2) preference orderings; 3) multiplicative preference relations; and 4) fuzzy preference relations. An optimization model is constructed to integrate the four formats of preference and to assess ranking values of alternatives. The model is shown to be theoretically sound and complete via a series of theorems, and then a corresponding algorithm is developed. A numerical example is given to illustrate the procedure. The proposed approach is more efficient and simpler than existing approaches because it does not need to unify different formats of preferences or to aggregate individual preferences into a collective one. Therefore, it overcomes a major shortcoming of existing approaches that lose or distort the original preference information in the process of unifying the formats},

abstract = {Interval utility values, interval fuzzy preference relations, and interval multiplicative preference relations are three common uncertain-preference formats used by decision-makers to provide their preference information in the process of decision making under fuzziness. This paper is devoted in investigating multiple-attribute group-decision-making problems where the attribute values are not precisely known but the value ranges can be obtained, and the decision-makers provide their preference information over attributes by three different uncertain-preference formats i.e., 1) interval utility values; 2) interval fuzzy preference relations; and 3) interval multiplicative preference relations. We first utilize some functions to normalize the uncertain decision matrix and then transform it into an expected decision matrix. We establish a goal-programming model to integrate the expected decision matrix and all three different uncertain-preference formats from which the attribute weights and the overall attribute values of alternatives can be obtained. Then, we use the derived overall attribute values to get the ranking of the given alternatives and to select the best one(s). The model not only can reflect both the subjective considerations of all decision-makers and the objective information but also can avoid losing and distorting the given objective and subjective decision information in the process of information integration. Furthermore, we establish some models to solve the multiple-attribute group-decision-making problems with three different preference formats: 1) utility values; 2) fuzzy preference relations; and 3) multiplicative preference relations. Finally, we illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed models with two practical examples.},

@article{Zimmermann2010,
abstract = {Since its inception in 1965, the theory of fuzzy sets has advanced in a variety of ways and in many disciplines. Applications of this theory can be found, for example, in artificial intelligence, computer science, medicine, control engineering, decision theory, expert systems, logic, management science, operations research, pattern recognition, and robotics. Mathematical developments have advanced to a very high standard and are still forthcoming to day. In this review, the basic mathematical framework of fuzzy set theory will be described, as well as the most important applications of this theory to other theories and techniques. Since 1992 fuzzy set theory, the theory of neural nets and the area of evolutionary programming have become known under the name of computational intelligence or soft computing. The relationship between these areas has naturally become particularly close. In this review, however, we will focus primarily on fuzzy set theory. Applications of fuzzy set theory to real problems are abound. Some references will be given. To describe even a part of them would certainly exceed the scope of this review.
