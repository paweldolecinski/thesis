abstract = {Paul Anand describes and evaluates many existing criticisms of the formal theory of rationality and subjective expected utility (SEU) theory. He tests the logical and philosophical basis for basing rational choice on SEU and argues that, empirically, SEU is false, and that normatively, it imposes unnecessary constraints on rational agency. He provides his own account of rational choice which is grounded in the relationship between an agent's preference and his or her behavior. In addition, he discusses some of the radical methodological changes in economics that form the basis for theoretical developments in decision theory.},

abstract = {Reaching a high level of consensus among experts is critical in group decision making problems. Usually, it is the moderator task to assure that the consensus process is carried out properly and, if possible, to offer recommendations to the expert in order to change their opinions and narrow their differences. In this paper we present an implemented web based consensus support system that is able to help, or even replace, the moderator in a consensus process where experts are allowed to provide their preferences using one of many types (fuzzy, linguistic and multi-granular linguistic) of incomplete preference relations. This system is based on both consistency and consensus measures and it has been designed to provide advice to the experts to increase group consensus level while maintaining the individual consistency of each expert. The consistency measures are characterized by and computed using uninorm operators. When appropriate, the system also helps experts to reduce the incompleteness of their preference relations. The web interface allows to carry out distributed consensus processes and thus, experts do not necessarily need to physically meet together.},

The model incorporates a mechanism that allows to manage dynamic decision situations in which some information about the problem is not constant in time. We assume that the set of alternatives can change during the decision making process. The model is presented in a mobile and dynamic context where the experts preferences can be incomplete. The linguistic approach is used to represent both the experts preferences about the alternatives and the agreement degrees to manage the change of some alternatives. A prototype of such mobile decision support system in which the experts use mobile devices to provide their linguistic preferences at anytime and anywhere has been implemented.

@inproceedings{Campanella2011,
abstract = {In the context of classical multiple attribute decision making (MADM), it is often assumed that, before taking a decision, the decision maker has a clear picture of all available alternatives and is able to rank them according to a fixed set of criteria, at a certain point in time. Most real-world decisions, however, are far from this ideal situation: they occur in a highly dynamic environment, where new, previously unconsidered alternatives may be added and others may be rendered unnecessary by means of some exploratory process. The same is true for criteria, which may likewise change either in number and/or its relative importance, depending on the dynamic environment the decision in being taken. Moreover, past information about the alternatives' behavior should be passed from iteration to iteration. In this paper we introduce a flexible model for multiple attribute decision making in a dynamic context that can be applied to any dynamic decision process. Because of the dynamism introduced with the spatial-temporal dimension, we consider a formulation using basic concepts from set theory, and then proceed to show it how it can be mapped (at any fixed time) to the more common decision matrix formulation. The proposed model is completely general and can be easily applied to different dynamic decision making problems. To highlight its versatility, we additionally present a simple example dealing with the problem of selecting a supplier from a pool of possible ones.},

abstract = {Interval utility values, interval fuzzy preference relations, and interval multiplicative preference relations are three common uncertain-preference formats used by decision-makers to provide their preference information in the process of decision making under fuzziness. This paper is devoted in investigating multiple-attribute group-decision-making problems where the attribute values are not precisely known but the value ranges can be obtained, and the decision-makers provide their preference information over attributes by three different uncertain-preference formats i.e., 1) interval utility values; 2) interval fuzzy preference relations; and 3) interval multiplicative preference relations. We first utilize some functions to normalize the uncertain decision matrix and then transform it into an expected decision matrix. We establish a goal-programming model to integrate the expected decision matrix and all three different uncertain-preference formats from which the attribute weights and the overall attribute values of alternatives can be obtained. Then, we use the derived overall attribute values to get the ranking of the given alternatives and to select the best one(s). The model not only can reflect both the subjective considerations of all decision-makers and the objective information but also can avoid losing and distorting the given objective and subjective decision information in the process of information integration. Furthermore, we establish some models to solve the multiple-attribute group-decision-making problems with three different preference formats: 1) utility values; 2) fuzzy preference relations; and 3) multiplicative preference relations. Finally, we illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed models with two practical examples.},
